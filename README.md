# saltcloud-virtualbox-provider

A salt cloud provider that lets you use virtualbox on your machine and act as a cloud.

It will interact with the virtualbox API which in turn interacts with VB hypervisor.

For now it's all local, but making it call virtualbox on another server should come sometime around.
